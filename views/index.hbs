                        Swytch exists to facilitate the transformation of energy markets to meet the demands of our
                        changing world. In today’s electricity markets, consumers depend on a centralized grid that
                        passes on both the cost of generating electricity and the cost of transmitting electricity on
                        the grid. While traditional technologies and markets have required this set up, solar production
                        in one’s home will soon be cheaper than grid transmission costs alone. At the same time, wind
                        and hydro technologies continue to see vast improvements in efficiency and battery technologies
                        are bringing storage costs down precipitously.

                        While the technology has improved exponentially, the transition to renewables has not kept pace.
                        Our solution to accelerate and scale this transformation is a blockchain-based utility token
                        called Swytch. Swytch seeks to verify the generation of sustainable energy and incentivize the
                        development of open and decentralized global energy infrastructures. This revolutionary program
                        will address many of the systemic issues that plague the renewable energy markets today.

                        Our goal is to harness token economics and the immutability of blockchain technology to create a
                        virtuous cycle that incentivizes the rapid global adoption of renewable energy by governments,
                        corporations, communities, and individuals. Our mission is clear, the need is obvious, and the
                        solution is sound. Let’s work together to accelerate the Swytch to a sustainable and equitable
                        energy future
